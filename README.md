# Chat Board dApp

A decentralized chat board dApp built on the Sepolia testnet using a Solidity smart contract, Hardhat for deployment, and a React front end with MetaMask integration.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a decentralized chat board where users can:
- **Post and View Messages:** Interact with the chat board by posting messages, which are stored on-chain.
- **Real-time Updates:** Automatically update the UI via smart contract events.
- **MetaMask Integration:** Use MetaMask for authentication and transactions.
- **Test on Sepolia:** Utilize the Sepolia testnet for deployment and testing.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js and npm/yarn:** Ensure you have these installed.
- **MetaMask:** Installed in your browser and set up with the Sepolia network (with test ETH from a faucet).
- **RPC Provider:** An account on Infura or Alchemy to obtain a Sepolia RPC URL.

## Getting Started

### 1. Hardhat Setup
- **Initialize Project:** Create a new directory, initialize npm, and install Hardhat along with necessary plugins.
- **Environment Variables:** Create a `.env` file with your Sepolia RPC URL and wallet private key.
- **Configure Network:** Update `hardhat.config.js` with the Sepolia network settings.

### 2. Smart Contract Development
- **Write Contract:** Create a Solidity contract (`ChatBoard.sol`) that defines the chat board logic.
- **Compile:** Use Hardhat to compile your contract.
- **Deploy:** Write and run a deployment script to deploy your contract to the Sepolia testnet. Save the deployed contract address.

### 3. React Front End
- **Create App:** Set up a React application (using Create React App).
- **Install Dependencies:** Install ethers.js and dotenv.
- **Integrate ABI:** Copy the contract ABI into your React project.
- **MetaMask Integration:** Update your React app to connect to MetaMask, interact with the contract, and handle real-time updates.

### 4. Running & Deployment
- **Local Testing:** Run the React app locally to test interactions.
- **Build & Deploy:** Once confirmed, build the React app and deploy it using your preferred hosting platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages).

## Video Tutorial

For a detailed, step-by-step walkthrough of the entire process—from setting up the Hardhat project and deploying the smart contract to integrating MetaMask in your React front end—watch the [Video Tutorial](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TN9Tblalhudd6aCWXaHIqL3ID7gTLPdy/view?usp=sharing).

## Additional Notes

- **Security & Gas Considerations:**  
  This project is a simple example. For production use, consider implementing enhanced security measures, gas optimizations, and robust error handling.

- **UX Enhancements:**  
  Feel free to improve the styling and user experience using modern CSS frameworks or styled-components.

Happy coding and enjoy your decentralized chat board dApp!
